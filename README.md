During this project we had to build an application with a structure of client-server side.

If you want to launch our client locally you can git clone our repository and then you need to have a few tools installed such as NodeJS mainly.

```
git clone https://github.com/Grem25/TWEB-Gamification-AngularJS
```
once you are inside and you have all the tools ready. You can sart the client with this command.
```
grunt dev
```
To be able to really test it you will need to run the server to be able to have the requests going and coming.

you want to play you can have the link of the game at this following address
